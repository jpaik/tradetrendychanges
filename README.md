# Trade Trendy Change Log
Change Log to Trade Trendy (Private Repo), because I need to be more organized

## Todo List
- [] Fix mobile grid/map to float right correctly
- [] Finalize FAQ page and questions
- [] Minify all scripts and css before launch
- [] Fix height of Star/grid item for Firefox

## Ideas for the future
* Checkbox onclick refreshes the grid: Need to figure out AJAX for that
* Filter inbox by Trade Requests
  * Inbox Row change trade request to trade finished?
* Dropdown Menu for shipping tracking postal company
  * If company, then link to their tracking.
  * EX:  %a{:href => "\https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction.action?tLabels=#{usps_code_other.to_s.delete(' ')}", :target => "\_blank"}
* Search by people's names + Brand
* Make username can't have a curse word
* Notification for Followed person's new listing
* Notification for new comments on posts
* Can't post listing without at least one photo

* Change settings -> account view
  * Make it so that the changing/cancelling is better. Probably using popup instead of alert
